Self-discovery and practices when I was learning Emotional Intelligence 2, to improve my EQ

Due to various reasons, I realized that improving my EQ is a necessity now. After doing a basic search, EI Emotional Intelligence 2.0 was chosed. Practice in memory maybe good for a short time, but it can disappear. Some of us studied difficulty math courses years ago, how much of that can be kept until now? 

In order to reminder myself, I decided to create a repository aims at a longer effective influence.
