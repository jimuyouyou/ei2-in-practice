# notes
- suspending judgement of emotions, allows them to run their course and vanish
- we tend to let good emotions like excitement run wild

# practices 
- goal: try to list 10 emotions that are unique to yourself
- definition: emotions unique to yourself means that compared to ordinary people, these emotions are stronger inside of you
